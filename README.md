<h2> NYCDSA Python Data Analysis Project on Oscar Movies and their Tropes </h2>
<p> This repository contains the workbooks used to scrape the tropes of various Oscar Nominated movies over time, from the <a href = https://tvtropes.org/>TvTropes </a> website. The tropes of those movies with high gross, and high Oscar win counts, particularly in the <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Big_Five_Academy_Award_winners_and_nominees> "Big Five" </a> Categories, were analyzed. Furthermore, those movies that did not win any nominations, and were extremely poorly performing at the box office were also polled as a comparison, and the tropes that distinguished those movies that won Oscars and those that didnt were conjectured. </p>

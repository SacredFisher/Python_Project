<h2>Python Data Analysis Project on Oscar Movies and their Tropes </h2>
<p> This repository contains the workbooks used to scrape the tropes of various Oscar Nominated movies over time, from the <a href = https://tvtropes.org/>TvTropes </a> website. The tropes of those movies with high gross, and high Oscar win counts, particularly in the <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Big_Five_Academy_Award_winners_and_nominees> "Big Five" </a> Categories, were analyzed. Furthermore, those movies that did not win any nominations, and were extremely poorly performing at the box office were also polled as a comparison, and the tropes that distinguished those movies that won Oscars and those that didnt were conjectured. This work was done as an exploratory project for Graviton Solutions, in order to see if user usage trends could be gathered from open source data combined with user sentiment and information about various movies.</p> 


## Project Summary 


The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an extremely reputable awards ceremony for movies. With regards to winning an Oscar, however, many movies with the overt intention of wooing the Academy tend to find themselves shunned, or box office flops. This is the difficulty of gaining the reputation as an "Oscar-Bait" movie. We would like to take a data driven approach to see if we can analyze the tropes that are found in movies that either A) Wins Oscars and Gross Highly, B) Nominated but did not win, and Gross Highly, C) Not nominated but Gross Highly, and D) Not Nominated and did not have high gross. By comparing the tropes found in the first two categories (essentially the Great, and Good categories) against the tropes found in the latter two (the poorly performing ones) we can see what tropes are winners with the Academy for nominations. By comparing the A and B categories, we are to find aspects that distinguish tropes that are nominated, from the tropes that win. 
Finally, we will choose a particular genre and type, and seek to gather the tropes to create the story for a Big Five Oscar-winning, Box-Office Smashing Crime Drama.
